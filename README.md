# ML-Asset-Pricing (Partial reproduction of the paper:Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning)
## Analyzed NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock data (1957 â€“ 2016), building neural networks (NN1-NN5) with recursive training and hyper-parameter tuning, incrementally expanding the dataset to predict returns. 
## Examined feature importance and performance, revealing a positive correlation between high R&D expenditure and stock returns.
